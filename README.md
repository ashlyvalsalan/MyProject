Thank you Straker Translation Team for considering me into the next level of selection process. It was actually a great opportunity to work in Vue.js . I was extremely new to this technology.But, it was not much difficult I think. It was easy than expected.

I have started from creating the components for listing the user. Then on that component, I have implemented the methods for getting the posts and its details.

The main problem I have encountered was with the UI , I got bit confused on how one component can be connected to another and how they can be displayed together.After refering online tutorials I got an idea on this . Along with this, as a fresher to this library, syntax was unfamiliar.
